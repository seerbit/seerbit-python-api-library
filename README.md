## Using the Library

<strong><h4>Initiate Account Option</h4></strong>
Instantiate a client and set the parameters. 

```python
    from seerbit.client import Client
    from seerbit.enums import EnvironmentEnum
    from seerbit.seerbitlib import Seerbit
    
    client = Client()
    client.api_base = Seerbit.LIVE_API_BASE
    client.environment = EnvironmentEnum.LIVE.value
    client.private_key = "private_key"
    client.public_key = "public_key"
    client.timeout = 20
```

To initiate a transaction request you need to perform authentication operation and acquire a token. 

```python
    from seerbit.service.authentication import Authentication

    auth_service = Authentication(client)
    auth_service.auth()
    token = auth_service.get_token()
```

After you have retrieved your token, pass it to the AccountService constructor along with your client object. You can then construct your payload and call the <code>authorize()</code> method of the AccountService class.
```python
    from random import randint
    from seerbit.service.account_service import AccountService
    
    random_number = randint(10000000, 99999999)
    payment_ref = "SBT_" + str(random_number)
    account_payload = {
        "publicKey": client.public_key,
        "amount": "100.00",
        "fee": "10",
        "fullName": "John Doe",
        "mobileNumber": "08037456590",
        "currency": "NGN",
        "country": "NG",
        "paymentReference": payment_ref,
        "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
        "productId": "Foods",
        "productDescription": "Uba Account Transaction ",
        "clientAppCode": "kpp64",
        "channelType": "BANK_ACCOUNT",
        "redirectUrl": "https://checkout.seerbit.com",
        "deviceType": "Apple Laptop",
        "sourceIP": "127.0.0.1:3456",
        "accountName": "John S Doe",
        "accountNumber": "1234567890",
        "bankCode": "033",
        "bvn": "12345678901",
        "dateOfBirth": "04011984",
        "retry": "false",
        "invoiceNumber": "1234567891abc123ac"
    }
    account_service = AccountService(client, token)
    json_response = account_service.authorize(account_payload)
```
